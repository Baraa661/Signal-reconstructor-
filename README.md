# Digital signal reconstruction and signal composer 
it is able to reconstruct a signal at the least processin time possible by utilizing The Nyquistâ€“Shannon theory

its main features are:
- Allow the user to open a mid-length signal and show it on the main graph
- The user can sample the read signal and see the sampled points highlighted on top of the signal
- The user can change the sampling rate via a slider that range from 0 Hz to 3fmax, where fmax is the maximum frequency in the read signal
- The app recovers the signal from the sampled points

- The user sees the reconstructed signal from the sampled points in two ways:
    * As a dotted signal on top of the original signal
    * A new signal in a secondary graph below the main graph.
- The user can toggle the visibility of the secondary graph 

- it provides the user with a primitive signal composer where s/he can generate basic signals to test and validate on the app.
